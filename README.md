## How does it work?
When activated, the app sets up a broadcast receiver, which becomes active at midnight or when the device boots up. Depending on the Weekday, the wallpaper image will be changed to the frog or to your old wallpaper.

## How do I use it?
It is very straightforward. Simply use the switch on the upper side of the screen to activate or disable the app:

The app is also available in German.
